                <p>This movie is 10 years old... HOW? I was 2 when it came out but I have watched it getting close to a thousand times I think. Its one of those movies thats just the amzing, family, feel good movie and I probably watch it at least twice a month if not more. I watch a lot of Disney (I have seen all of the animated theatrical releases and nearly all the live actions as well as the sequels) but Tangled is my favourite out if all of them. Mother Gothel has just the right amount of creepiness to make her a proper Disney villain on a scale with Scar, Ursula and Gaston and Hans and the dramatic irony is just the right amount to make you believe she is just an over protective mother for a while. Pascal and Maximus are by far the greatest disney sidekicks Disney has created they don't talk but are just so perfectly hilarious. Rapunzel is a fearless princess with an amazing personality but Eugene "Flynn Ryder" Fitzherbert is by far the most logical, funniest disney male lead out there with Moana and maui, and Tiana and naveen coming in closely behind. I'd advise anyone with a sense of humor, who loves strong females, funny animals and a handsome prince and of course songs to watch this movie Immediately.

                <p>My all time favorite movie to exist. I want to start off by saying how beautifully written this movie was. The chemistry and love between Eugene/flynn and Rapunzel is everything I want in life. This is my comfort movie and I watch it every week. I am extremely obsessed with Tangled and I am not ashamed because it is a gorgeous movie. The animation that these artists went with is so incredible. Rapunzel's hair is 70 ft long and the animators had to create that flowy,glowy,silky effect throughout the entire movie. I find that so fascinating. This movie is 5/5 forever and I wish they made another one with the same animation style. Flynn and Rapunzel are my favorite couple to exist due to their story. First they didn't like each other, but flynn realized what he was missing in life; love. The way he was going to die for her really shows how his character develops. Really amazing movie and I wouldn't change anything about it!</p>

                <p>One of the most underrated Disney films to date. This is my third time watching it and It’s amazing. Before we even get into the plot let’s just talk about the beautiful animation. It made me feel like I was in a whole other world when I was watching it. Beautiful graphics. The plot itself was amazing and mother gothel has to be one of the best antagonist I’ve come across. The music was spectacular and I expected no less since Mandy Moore was singing. But even the lyrics struck an emotional cord within me. Finally Flynn rider is one of the best love interest I’ve seen in a Disney movie because he is actually given a personality outside of falling in love like all of the other Disney princess movies. He’s loveable and is equally as enjoyable in the movie as rapunzel. Also Maximus and pascal are an amazing addition. Has to be one of my favorite animated movies of all time.

                <p>It has great story pacing and character chemistry that makes you care a lot about how Rapunzel and Eugenes relationship develop. The lantern scene and Eugenes death scene are some of the most beautiful I’ve ever seen in a movie. The humor is clever and creative and the songs greatly set the mood for their scenes. It does the opposite of many cliches of previous Disney movies. Eugene has subtle self awareness of Disney tropes that are part of the movies humor. None of the two lead characters fall in love until they learn more about each other throughout their journey. They don’t get married until years after the films events, as stated by Eugene at the end. The princess helps the man as much as he helps her. The female saves the male. The moral is about trying to fulfill dreams and that there’s always more dreams to have after it’s fulfilled, which is a very inspiring and more applicable message people can relate to than that of the later movies. It’s strange to me that Tangled isn’t talked about as much as the later Disney movies and that some people don’t think it’s as original. Tangled is my favorite movie.</p>

                <p>Tangled is one of my favourite childhood films, as it brings back great memories. Looking back, the film is rather underwhelming, as the story is extremely predictable, if only we found out that Gothel kidnapped Rapunzel at the end of the film, the rating to this film would be five stars. Other than that, this film has quality animation, good comedic value for a children’s film and a bright storyline. The musical element adds a nice touch to the film. On the whole, a great film, would love to see a sequel or a live action take on it.

                <p>Sweet movie. My 3yo granddaughter loves it. Easy for her to follow and understand. Doesn’t have a complex storyline. No truly scary characters like some of the other Disney movies. Even when  characters are introduced that are sketchy there are songs or they are short intervals.

                <p>Amazing 10/10 animations and a decent plot. However, the characters just felt pretty meh to me so it was hard to get very into the movie.
